    <p id="p-1" num="1">-14- P6442 Abstract Friction-tolerant disks made of fiber-reinforced ceramic Use of polymer-bound fiber tows containing carbon fibers, the polymer- bound fiber tows having an average length of 3 mm to 50 mm measured in the fiber direction<confidence value="6">,</confidence>
 and an average bundle thickness of 0.1 mm to 10 mm measured perpendicular to the fiber direction, and in which at least 75% of all polymer-bound fiber tows have a length that is at least 90% and not greater than 110% of the average length, in the manufacture of carbon- ceramic brake disks and carbon-ceramic clutch disks.    </p>
